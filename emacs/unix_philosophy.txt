The Unix Philosophy
From The UNIX Programming Environment (1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike

Even though The UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, no single progam or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although That philosophy can't be writtendown in a single sentence, at it;s heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from relationships amoung programs than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs do quite trivial things in isoloation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools.
