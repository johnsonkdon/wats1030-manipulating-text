The Unix Philosophy 
From The UNIX Programming Environment (1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike 

Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effetive is the approach to programming, a philosophy os using the computer. Although that philosophy can't be written down in a single sentence, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationship among programs than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs do white trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools.
